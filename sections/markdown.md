# Creating a Syllabus with Markdown

Using `cd`, navigate to the `git-practice` folder inside `projects`. From your home directory, type:

	cd Desktop/projects/git-practice

Now we're going to initialize our repository, which means telling Git to pay attention to it:

	git init

You should see output like this:

	Initialized empty Git repository in /home/patrick/projects/git/.git/
	
Now Git is tracking our directory. But before that's useful, we'll have to create a text file for Git to track. For this session, the file we'll track will be a course syllabus—we'll create that next.

### Creating a Syllabus in Markdown

Let's use our text editor, VS Code, to create and edit a syllabus file in the folder. Make sure VS Code is installed before taking this step.

While in the `git-practice` folder, in the terminal, type

	code syllabus.md
	
to open a `syllabus.md` file in VS Code. You should see a window appear that looks similar to this:

![Image of what VS Code looks like when opening the syllabus.md file](../images/vscode1.png)

If VS Code does not open when you use the `code` command in your terminal, open it using the Start Menu on Windows or Spotlight Search on Mac OS as you would any other software. Then click `File > Open File` and use the dialog to navigate to the `/Users/<your-name>/Desktop/projects/git` folder and create a `syllabus.md` file there.

We'll be typing our markdown into this VS Code window. At any time, you can save your file by hitting `Control-s` on Windows or `⌘-s` on Mac OS. Alternatively, you can click the `File` menu on the top right, then select `Save` from the dropdown menu.

## Using Markdown

We'll be using markdown to create a syllabus, and then using Git to track it. Markdown is a markup format that allows us to denote formatting like headings, emphasis, links, and lists in a readable form. Markdown files usually have a `.md` extension.

In markdown, we insert headings like this:

	# My Syllabus Heading
	
A sub-heading (H2) heading looks like this:

	## Readings
	
To provide emphasis, place asterisks around some text:

	*This text will appear italicized.*
	**This text will appear bold.**
	
To create a list, put a hyphen at the beginning of each list item:

	- Reading one
	- Reading two
	- Reading three
	
To create a link, put the anchor text (the text you will see) in square brackets and the URL in parentheses. Don't put a space between them:

	I teach at [The Graduate Center, CUNY](https://www.gc.cuny.edu).
	
Paragraphs of text are denoted by putting a blank line between them:

> This is a paragraph in markdown. It's separated from the paragraph below with a blank line. If you know HTML, it's kind of like the \<p> tag. That means that there is a little space before and after the paragraph when it is rendered.
> 
> This is a second paragraph in markdown, which I'll use to tell you what I like about markdown. I like markdown because it looks pretty good, if minimal, whether you're looking at the rendered or unrendered version. It's like tidy HTML.


Try using these five elements—headings, emphasis, lists, links, and paragraphs—to create a syllabus. Have a main heading that gives the course title (one `#`), then subheadings for, at least, course info and readings. Use emphasis (`*`) for book titles and try to get a list in there somewhere.

You can look at an example syllabus in raw text form [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/master/sections/syllabus.md). When it's rendered by GitHub, it looks like [this](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/git/blob/master/sections/syllabus.md). When editing the markdown file in VS Code, it might look like this:

VS Code also has a preview feature for your markdown. Hit the preview button on the top right while editing your markdown file:

![Button to hit to get a preview in VS Code](../images/vscode3.png)

You'll get two side-by-side panels. Your markdown file will be on the left, and your rendered preview will be on the right:

Remember to save your work with `Control-s` on Windows or `⌘-s` on Mac OS.
