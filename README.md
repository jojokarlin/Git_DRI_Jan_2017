# Collaboration and Tracking Workflows with Git and GitHub

**Workshop Goal**: Create a Git repository on your computer, add files, and push this repository to your GitHub.

Learn what makes Github such a powerful tool for both collaborative and individual projects in this introductory workshop. We will share a conceptual overview of Git and Github, teach the basics of how to get started, and explore practical applications of Github for writing and computational workflows. This workshop will be applicable for a wide range of digital undertakings, from developing code, to working with datasets, to drafting public policy, and beyond.
