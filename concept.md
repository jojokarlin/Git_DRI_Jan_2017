#Git, GitHub, and Markdown: A Brief Conceptual Overview

## What is Git? 

**Git** is a version control tool. It lives on your computer (is local), and is accessed through the command line. 

Git tracks changes when the user tells it to `git add` cues up revisions, and `git commit` adds modified files. All files live in the `.git` repository--again, on your computer.

Git is the **local** power behind *version control*.

## What is GitHub?

**Github** is a hosting service for git repositories. You must first set up an account and configure it on your computer. Once your local **git** repository and **Github** are connected, you can make copies of other users' repositories, edit them, and send your proposed changes back to the user who can then choose to incorporate your work into their repository. 

Github _connects_ Git repositories remotely and is the power behind *collaboration*.

_If you have not signed up for a GitHub account, go to [http://github.com/](http://github.com/). Remember to save your user name, email, and password as you will need this information twice more!_

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to _mark up_ text in a quick and lightweight manner to format the text, rendering more attractive files. 

You can think of markdown as a language read by many platforms and sites, including GitHub, to stylize text. Markdown is also thought to be more sustainable over time, since it is a plain text file. You'll notice this file is in markdown--check out its extension!

To help you format your text (use markdown to translate plain to _pizzaz_), try this cheat-sheet: [GitHub Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). I used it as a reference to create this repo.
