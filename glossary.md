##Glossary
Here's a glossary for the basic Git and Github terms that you'll need for this workshop:

**Git**: the version-control tool that lives on your computer. 

**working directory**: a group of files you're in the process of editing.

**directory**: in your GUI, a folder. A file system data structure.

**GUI**: graphical user interface, or anything on a computer or browser where you can point at an icon and click. In contrast to the command line, where you give direct commands to the computer by typing them out.

**repository**: the data structure in which git stores its information on the files and the changes that have occurred in each.

**repo**: when you just don't have time to type 'repository!'

**GitHub**: the hosting service that stores your repos and allows others to interact with them

**fork**: the way others interact with and can modify your Github repos. Forking makes a copy of someone's repo in a way that connects back to the original repo, but lets you modify it without altering the original.

**clone**: a local copy of a repo you've forked. cloning lets you work offline. 

**push**: "pushes," or sends your local Git repo and its committed changes to a remote repo, as in on GitHub.

**pull**: fetching and merging remote changes to your local copy.

**pull request**: these are generally made using GitHub's GUI, and consist of proposed changes to a repo that you've forked. A pull request notifies the owner of the repo you've forked that you'd like your changes to be merged, and shows the proposed changes.

**master branch**: the main version of a repository, into which all other branches must be integrated.

**branch**: Git allows you to create new branches, or versions, off the master branch. These are particularly useful for larger code projects and development, since they allow you to work on and keep track of multiple discrete sections that can be merged back into the master branch.

_If there's anything missing, remember that you can fork this repo, add what you'd like to see, and send a pull request!_
