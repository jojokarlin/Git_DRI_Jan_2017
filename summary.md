# Summary

Through this workshop, we have learned:

Git is for version control
GitHub is for collaboration
Markdown is language for formatting text (a way to styliize plain text).

`git config` tells Git who is working
`git init` tells Git which repo to monitor
`git add` tells Git to track this file
`git commit` tells Git to log this version (`-m` with a note about it)
`git push` puts this local version up on your remote GitHub repo
`git clone` makes a local copy of a remote repo from GitHub
`git pull` logs any remote changes to your local repo
`git status` tells us if things are in sync

## Final note
Remember, what you don't know can _always_ be Googled or looked up on Stack Overflow!
